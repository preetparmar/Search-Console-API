# Search-Console-API

Limitations of Search Console Platform:
- Can't export more than 1000 rows.
- Can't export data by Day, Keyword, Pages, Device.

Use case for me:
- Export data broken out by Day, Keyword and Pages for Analysis purpose.
- Export all the rows _(more than the default 1000)_ in order to do a deep dive analysis.

About the project:
- I have used Python to write this Search Console API which takes the URL, Start Date and End Date from the user.
- I created my own Class in order to make future edits easier and managable.
- I have also created a GUI using tkinter library in order to make it user friendly.
- Things I learned during the project:
	- Google Authorization Library
	- Python Libraries: pandas, datetime, os
	- Python Classes
	- Error Handling
	- tkinter:
		- Canvas, Frames and Design
		- Widgets: Buttons, List Box, Text Entry
		- Scrollbars
